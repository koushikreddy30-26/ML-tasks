# Movie Data Analysis and Text Processing using Python

## Description
This project performs analysis on a movie dataset using Python in Google Colab.
It includes data loading, exploration, and natural language processing (NLP)
techniques such as text cleaning and stopword removal using NLTK.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK

## Dataset
- Movie dataset in CSV format
- Contains movie-related attributes and text data
- Used for data analysis and text preprocessing

## Project Workflow
1. Importing required Python libraries
2. Loading the movie dataset using Pandas
3. Exploring dataset structure and information
4. Performing text preprocessing using NLTK
5. Analyzing and displaying processed data

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset file when required
3. Run all cells sequentially
